/**
 * Returns the current time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00.0 UTC.
 *
 * <p>This method always uses UTC, regardless of the system's time zone.
 * This is often called "Unix time" or "epoch time". The Unix time is efficient and commonly 
 * used across platforms. Use a {@link java.time.Instant} to work with this time.
 * Use a {@link java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter} instance to format this time for display to a human.
 * This format enables proper handling of time zones and avoids threading issues as handled by 
 * java.time classes.
 *
 * <h4>Time Zone Importance</h4>
 * It is often necessary and desirable to include the timezone in the output. It may also be 
 * desirable to set the formatter's time zone to UTC (to ease comparison or to make logs more 
 * readable, for example). When sending dates/times in machine-readable form, simply sending 
 * the "Unix time" as an integer is cheaper and unambiguous, and can be formatted any way the 
 * recipient deems appropriate.
 *
 * <h4>Synchronization</h4>
 * {@code SimpleDateFormat} is not thread-safe. It is recommended to use 
 * ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> or the java.time package for thread-safe date handling.
 *
 * The deprecated {@code Date} class is transitioning to modern alternatives such as 
 * {@code Instant}, {@code LocalDateTime}, and {@code ZonedDateTime}, which offer better 
 * functionality and safety.
 *
 * @return current time in milliseconds since the epoch
