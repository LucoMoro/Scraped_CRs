/**
 * Returns the current time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00.0 UTC.
 *
 * <p>This method always uses UTC, regardless of the system's time zone.
 * This is often called "Unix time" or "epoch time".
 * It is recommended to use {@link java.time.Instant} for precision, and to format
 * this time for display, you can use {@link java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter}.
 * 
 * <h4>Timezone Handling</h4>
 * Note that it is almost always necessary and desirable to include the timezone in the output.
 * It is often best to avoid formatting completely when writing dates/times in machine-readable form.
 * Simply sending the "Unix time" as an integer is cheaper and unambiguous.
 *
 * <h4>Synchronization</h4>
 * {@code SimpleDateFormat} is not thread-safe. Users should use {@link java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter}
 * instead for thread-safe formatting.
 *
 * <h4>Deprecation Notice</h4>
 * The {@code Date} and {@code Calendar} classes are deprecated. Use the {@code java.time} API for improved accuracy and usability.
