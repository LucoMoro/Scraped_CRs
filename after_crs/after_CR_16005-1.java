* <p>The screen density of a device is based on the screen resolution. A screen with low density
* has fewer available pixels per inch, where a screen with high density
 * has more - sometimes significantly more - pixels per inch. The density of a
* screen is important because, other things being equal, a UI element (such as a button) whose
* height and width are defined in terms of screen pixels will appear larger on the lower density
* screen and smaller on the higher density screen.
